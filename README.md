# NeurIPS 2020 - Procgen Starter Kit with Amazon SageMaker Reinforcement Learning
This is the Amazon SageMaker Reinforcement Learning starter kit for the [NeurIPS 2020 - Procgen competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-procgen-competition) hosted on [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/).

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables you to build and deploy models faster and with less heavy lifting. Amazon SageMaker has built-in features to assist with data labeling and preparation; training, tuning and debugging models; and deploying and monitoring models in production. This notebook uses the fully managed RL capabilities in Amazon SageMaker, which include pre-packaged RL toolkits and fully managed model training and deployment and builds on top of the algorithms and libraries of the [NeurIPS 2020 - Procgen competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-procgen-competition) hosted on [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/) Additionally, Amazon SageMaker Managed Spot Training is used to reduce training costs by up to 90%.

For more information about applying RL to domains such as recommendation systems, robotics, financial management, and more, see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/tree/master/reinforcement_learning).

# 🕵️ About ProcGen Benchmark

The [ProcGen](https://github.com/openai/procgen) environment is a 16 simple-to-use procedurally-generated [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environments which provide a direct measure of how quickly a reinforcement learning agent learns generalizable skills.  The environments run at high speed (thousands of steps per second) on a single core.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/procgen/master/screenshots/procgen.gif)

These environments are associated with the paper [Leveraging Procedural Generation to Benchmark Reinforcement Learning](https://cdn.openai.com/procgen.pdf) [(citation)](#citation). Compared to [Gym Retro](https://github.com/openai/retro), these environments are:

* Faster: Gym Retro environments are already fast, but Procgen environments can run >4x faster.
* Non-deterministic: Gym Retro environments are always the same, so you can memorize a sequence of actions that will get the highest reward.  Procgen environments are randomized so this is not possible.
* Customizable: If you install from source, you can perform experiments where you change the environments, or build your own environments.  The environment-specific code for each environment is often less than 300 lines.  This is almost impossible with Gym Retro.

Asset information of the procgen environment could be found [here](https://github.com/openai/procgen/blob/master/ASSET_LICENSES.md).

# 💪 Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker 

### Get an AWS account

You will need an AWS account to use this solution. Sign up for an account here (https://aws.amazon.com/).
You will also need to have permission to use AWS CloudFormation (https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and to create all the resources detailed in the architecture section (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-fleet-predictive-maintenance/#architecture). All AWS permissions can be managed through AWS IAM (https://aws.amazon.com/iam/). Admin users will have the required permissions, but please contact your account's AWS administrator if your user account doesn't have the required permissions.

### Architecture
As part of the solution, the following services are used:

1. [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Used to store datasets.
2. [Amazon SageMaker Notebook](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/): Used to preprocess and visualize the data, and to train the deep learning model.

Amazon SageMaker Reinforcement Learning utilizes [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and [RLLib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib.html) same as in the starter kit. Amazon SageMaker supports distributed RL in a single Amazon SageMaker ML instance with just a few lines of configuration by using the Ray RLlib library.

A typical Amazon SageMaker Reinforcement Learning job for an actro-critic algorithm will use GPU instances to learning a policy network and CPU instances to collect experiences for faster training at optimized costs. Amazon SageMaker allows you to achieve this by spinning up two jobs within the same Amazon VPC, and the communications between the instances are taken care of automatically. The following diagram illustrates the architecture in which the primary job consumes one GPU instance and the secondary job consumes three CPU instances.

# FAQs

## How long does it take to reach 8MM steps for various training instance types?
The AWS CloudFormation will help you get started with a GPU instance `ml.p3.2xlarge`. This instance has 1 GPU and 8 vCPUs. We benchmarked our notebook with configuration in `experiments\impala-baseline.yaml` and neural network in `models\impala_cnn_tf.py` on `ml.p3.2xlarge` instance. With 70% spot instance savings, running the IMPALA benchmark costs about $1.0 based on September 2020 rates. 

<img src="docs/impala_benchmark_baseline_p3_2x.png" height="800">

Next, we run the baseline `experiments\impala-baseline.yaml` on other GPU instance to help reduce cost or increase performance. Below is a table comparing various instances to the IMPALA baseline.

<img src="docs/Table_CompareInstances.png" height="256">

The corresponding mean episode for each configuration (column) in the above table for BigFish environment up to 8MM steps is shown below.

<img src="docs/impala_benchmark_instances.png" height="200">

The key take-aways are:
* Switching to `ml.g4n.4xlarge` will help you save 40% per environment at the cost of increasing the training time from 45 minutes to about an hour.
* Switching to `ml.p3.8xlarge` is more cost effective than scaling to multiple instances of `ml.p3.2xlarge`. You can further reduce training time to less than 25 minutes by increasing `num_envs_per_worker` from 12 to 48 and scaling for `num_gpus` to avoid out-of-memory errors.


## How do I change the notebook instance type?
The Amazon SageMaker notebook instance type is configured as part of the cloud formation parameters. The default instance type in the cloud formation stack is `ml.c5.4xlarge`. If you wish to change the instance type, you would need to change the parameter for the notebook instance. This instance type enables you to run your notebook in `local mode` to quickly test your custom model, parameters, or algorithms in the notebook instance. We recommended that once you debug customizations, then you can switch to a notebook instance with smaller compute and use powerful compute instances to iterate through various hyper-parameters in training.

## How do I change the training instance type(s)?
You can change the instance type to a GPU or CPU instance. In the notebook, the docker container is selected according to the type of the instance, e.g., the GPU instances start with `ml.p` or `ml.g`. There are there steps to configuring the instance type for training:

Step 1: Prior to changing the instance type you need to confirm that your AWS account limit for the specific instance. Please, refer to the instructions on the [Amazon EC2 Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) on how to confirm the instance limits.

Step 2: In `train.ipynb`, go to the section titled *Configure training instance type* and override `instance_type`.

Step 3: You need to make sure that your Ray training job is configured to use the resources in the training instance. Go to `source\train-sagemaker.py`. 

To automatically scale the RL training to several workers, you can adjust the `num_cpus` and `num_gpus` parameters. You must reserve 1 CPU (the 1 in num_cpus - 1) to act as the driver. For example, if you select a training instance type with at least 4 CPUs, then configure a training job with multiple workers in a single Amazon SageMaker instance by settting 'num_cpus' = 3 and 'num_gpus' = 0.

We recommend to use fractional GPUs based on your neural network model. For example, if you are using `neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/models/impala_cnn_tf.py`, use the following configuration in `source/train-sagemaker.py` for a `p3.2xlarge` instance

```
  "num_workers": 7, # adjust based on ray_num_cpus
  "num_gpus": 0.2, # adjust based on ray_num_gpus
  "num_gpus_per_worker": 0.1, # adjust based on (ray_num_gpus - num_gpus)/(1 + num_workers)

```

## How do I use multiple homogeneous or heteregenous instances for training?
Amazon SageMaker supports distributed RL in a single Amazon SageMaker ML instance with just a few lines of configuration by using the Ray RLlib library.

In homogeneous scaling, you use multiple instances with the same type (typically CPU instances) for a single Amazon SageMaker job. A single CPU core is reserved for the driver, and you can use all the remaining as rollout workers which generate experiences through environmental simulations. The number of available CPU cores increases with multiple instances. Homogeneous scaling is beneficial when experience collection is the bottleneck of the training workflow; for example, when your environment is computationally heavy.

With more rollout workers, neural network updates can often become the bottleneck. In this case, you could use heterogeneous scaling, in which you use different instance types together. A typical choice would be to use GPU instances to perform network optimization and CPU instances to collect experiences for faster training at optimized costs. Amazon SageMaker allows you to achieve this by spinning up two jobs within the same Amazon VPC, and the communications between the instances are taken care of automatically.

To run distributed training with multiple instances use `train-homo-distributed.ipynb` and `train-hetero-distributed.ipynb` for homogenous and heteregenous scaling respectively. The configurable parameters for distributed training are stored in `source/train-sagemaker-distributed.py`. Note that you do not have to configure `ray_num_cpus` or `ray_num_gpus`. Remember to scale `num_workers` and `train_batch_size` to reflect the number of instances in the notebook. For example, if you set `train_instance_count = 5` for a `p3.2xlarge` instance, the maximum number of workers will be 39 as follows
```
  "num_workers": 8*5 -1, # adjust based on total number of CPUs available in the cluster, e.g., p3.2xlarge has 8 CPUs
  "num_gpus": 0.2, # adjust based on number of GPUs available in a single node, e.g., p3.2xlarge has 1 GPU
  "num_gpus_per_worker": 0.1, # adjust based on number of GPUs, e.g., p3.2x large (1 GPU - num_gpus) / num_workers = 0.1
  "rollout_fragment_length": 140,
  "train_batch_size": 64 * (8*5 -1),
```

## How do I configure algorithm parameters?
To configure your RLLib algorithm parameters, go to your notebook folder and open `source/train-sagemaker-distributed-*.py`. A subset of algorithm parameters are provided for PPO but for the full set of algorithm specific parameters, refer to the RLLib documentation, e.g., for [PPO](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib-algorithms.html#ppo). For baselines provided in the starter kit, refer to `experiments\*.yaml` files and copy additional parameters to the RLLib configuration parameters in the `source/train-sagemaker-distributed-*.py`.

To check whether your model is using the correct parameters, go to the Amazon S3 bucket and navigate to the JSON file with parameters, e.g., `{Amazon SageMaker training job} >output>intermediate>training>{PPO_procgen_env_wrapper_*}>param.json`


## How do I use spot instances?
To use spot instance, you need to set the flag `train_use_spot_instances = False` in the final cell of 
`train-homo-distributed.ipynb` or `train-hetero-distributed.ipynb`.


## How do I add a custom Model ? 
To add a custom model, create a file inside `models/` directory and name it `models/my_vision_network.py`.

Please refer [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/blob/master/models/my_vision_network.py ) for a working implementation of how to add a custom model. You can then set the `custom_model` field in the experiment yaml to `my_vision_network` to cause that model to be used.

Make sure that the model is registered. If you get an error that your model is not registered, go to `train-sagmaker.py` or `train-sagmaker-distributed.py` and edit `def register_algorithms_and_preprocessors(self)` by adding 
```
ModelCatalog.register_custom_model("impala_cnn_tf", ImpalaCNN)
```


## How do I add a custom Algorithm/Trainable/Agent ?
Please refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/AIcrowd/neurips2020-procgen-starter-kit/blob/master/experiments/procgen-starter-example.yaml#L4).


## What configs parameters do I have available ? 
All the configuration variables for Ray and RLLib are available in `train-sagmaker.py` for single instance and `train-sagmaker-distributed.py` for training with multiple instances.


## How do I visualize the algorithm metrics while training ?
There are several options to visualize algorithm metrics. A detailed blog can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/easily-monitor-and-visualize-metrics-while-training-models-on-amazon-sagemaker/).


Option 1 (Amazon CloudWatch): You can go to the [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) metrics dashboard from your account to monitor and visualize the algorithm metrics as well as track the GPU and CPU usage. The training jobs details page has a direct link to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics dashboard for the metrics emitted by the training algorithm.

Option 2 (Amazon SageMaker Python SDK API): You can also visualize the metrics inline in your Amazon SageMaker Jupyter notebooks using the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK APIs. Please, refer to the section titled *Visualize algorithm metrics for training* in `train.ipynb`.


Option 3: To use Tensorboard, you need to setup an s3 bucket to upload data. In `train-homo-distributed.ipynb`, go to the last cell and uncomment
```
#"rl.training.upload_dir": s3_output_path + "/tensorboard_sync", # Uncomment to view tensorboard
```
